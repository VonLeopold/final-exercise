# final-exercise
NYCDA - budgetr

This is the final exercise of the 2 week coding bootcamp by NYCDA Amsterdam. The exercise was to build an budget calculator using HTML, CSS, JavaScript/jQuery.

I've build this code from the ground up. No templates were used. 

You can use this code for educational purpuses. Note that I do not own the image (background).

See ya!
